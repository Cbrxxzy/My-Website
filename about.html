    <td><b>About me</b><br>
            <p class=double>I live in Las Vegas Nevada with my wife and my cat edward for my free time I like to play video games or fix and clean them when I have the chance I like breaking them down and see how everything works. Also I went to school at Las Vegas High School and gradutated in 2016. Im excited for this program because it can help me learn new things everything i learned so far is new to me but I like that Im getting the hang of things and hopefully i can pass the program and get a job doing something I love. Below i do have links to My Socials but theres nothing much to it </p>
